Given a `word`, check whether it is a palindrome or not. A string is considered to be a palindrome if it reads the same in both directions.

##### Example

For `word = "aibohphobia"`, the output should be
`solution(word) = true`;

For `word = "hehehehehe"`, the output should be
`solution(word) = false`.
