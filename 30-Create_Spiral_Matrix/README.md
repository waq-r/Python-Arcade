A spiral matrix is a square matrix of size `n Ã— n`. It contains all the integers in range from `1` to `n * n` so that number `1` is written in the bottom right corner, and all other numbers are written in increasing order spirally in the counterclockwise direction.

Given the size of the matrix `n`, your task is to create a spiral matrix.

##### Example

For `n = 3`, the output should be

```py
solution(n) = [[5, 4, 3],
               [6, 9, 2],
               [7, 8, 1]]
```
