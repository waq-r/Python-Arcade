# Primes Sum

It is believed by some tribes of South Codelenica that only two events determine the person's destiny: the first time he picked a flower, and the first time he planted one. They also believe in the power of prime numbers and in the power of sums (and a bunch of other most probably unrelated stuff), so you are wondering if it has something to do with their belief in the destiny-determining events.

You know that you first picked a flower in year a of the Codelenican calendar, and planted it in year b. Now you're curious about the sum of all the prime numbers in the range [a, b], to see if this number could possibly affect your life.

##### Prime Numbers

A positive integer that cannot be formed by multiplying together two smaller positive integers. In other words, it's a number n > 1 that can only be evenly divided by 1 and n itself.

##### Examples:

5 is prime
2 is prime
6 is composite (not prime) because 2 × 3 = 6
49 is composite (not prime) because 7 × 7 = 49
Example

For `a = 10` and` b = 20`, the output should be
`solution(a, b) = 60`.

There are 4 prime numbers in the range [10, 20]: 11, 13, 17 and 19. Their sum is equal to 11 + 13 + 17 + 19 = 60. It's a round number, maybe it does mean something?..
