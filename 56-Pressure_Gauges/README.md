Harry dropped out of school to pursue his dreams and work in Pipes Corporations. He is now in charge of a lot of pipes, and his task is to check the gauges twice a day. By analyzing the `morning` and `evening` pressures of each pipe, Harry should write a report about the minimum and the maximum pressure during the day.

Given the pressures Harry wrote down for each pipe, return two lists: the first one containing the minimum, and the second one containing the maximum pressure of each pipe during the day.

##### Example

For `morning = [3, 5, 2, 6]` and `evening = [1, 6, 6, 6]`,
the output should be
`solution(morning, evening)` = `[[1, 5, 2, 6], [3, 6, 6, 6]]`.
