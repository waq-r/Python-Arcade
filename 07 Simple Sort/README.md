To understand how efficient the built-in Python sorting function is, you decided to implement your own simple sorting algorithm and compare its speed to the speed of the Python sorting. Write a function that, given an array of integers arr, sorts its elements in ascending order.

Hint: with Python it's possible to swap several elements in a single line. To solve the task, use this knowledge to fill in both of the blanks (...).

##### Example

For `arr = [2, 4, 1, 5]`, the output should be
solution(arr) = `[1, 2, 4, 5]`.

##### Input/Output

[execution time limit] 4 seconds (py)

[memory limit] 1 GB

[input] array.integer arr

Guaranteed constraints:
`1 ≤ arr.length ≤ 500,
-105 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 105.`

[output] array.integer

The given array with elements sorted in ascending order.
