John has just entered a college, and should now pick several courses to take. He knows nothing, except that number `x` is a bad luck for him, which is why he won't even consider courses whose title consist of `x` letters.

Given a list of `courses`, remove the courses with titles consisting of `x` letters and return the result.

##### Example

For `x = 7` and
`courses = ["Art", "Finance", "Business", "Speech", "History", "Writing", "Statistics"]`,
the output should be
`solution(x, courses) = ["Art", "Business", "Speech", "Statistics"]`.
