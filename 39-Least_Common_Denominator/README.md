You need to sum up a bunch of fractions that have different `denominators`. In order to do this, you need to find the least common denominator of all the fractions. As a professional programmer, you know that the least common `denominator` is in fact their LCM.

##### LCM

Least common multiple (LCM) of numbers a and b is defined as the smallest number that is divisible by both a and b.

For the given list of denominators, find the least common denominator by finding their LCM.

##### Example

For `denominators = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, the output should be
`solution(denominators) = 60.`
