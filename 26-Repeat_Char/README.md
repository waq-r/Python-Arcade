# Repeat Char

To make debug output more understandable, you often separate sets of logs by a single line of the same character. Since you use this method very often, you'd like to write a function that would handle printing the separator.

Implement a function that, given a character `ch` and the number of times it should be repeated `n`, returns a string of `n `characters `ch`.

##### Example

For `ch = '*'` and `n = 20`, the output should be
`solution(ch, n) = "********************"`.
