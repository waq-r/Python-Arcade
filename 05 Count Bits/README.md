Implement a function that, given an integer n, uses a specific method on it and returns the number of bits in its binary representation.

Note: in this task and most of the following tasks you will be given a code snippet with some part of it replaced by the ellipsis (...). Only this part is allowed to be changed.

Example

For n = 50, the output should be
solution(n) = 6.

5010 = 1100102, a number that consists of 6 digits. Thus, the output should be 6.
